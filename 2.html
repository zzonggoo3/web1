  <h1>Rules</h1>
  The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, Laws of Badminton.

  <h2>Court</h2>

  The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only.

  <h2>Serving</h2>
  The legal bounds of a badminton court during various stages of a rally for singles and doubles games
  When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault.

  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  Main article: Scoring system development of badminton
  Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served[13] (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.

  <h1>Equipment</h1>
  Badminton racquets
  Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.

  <h2>Racquets</h2>
  Badminton racquets are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95 grams (2.5 and 3.4 ounces) not including grip or strings.

  <h2>Strings</h2>
  Badminton strings for racquets are thin, high performing strings with thicknesses ranging from about 0.62 to 0.73 mm. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings.

  <h2>Grip</h2>
  The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.

  <h2>Shuttlecock</h2>

  <br>Main article: Shuttlecock
  A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to shuttle; also called a birdie) is a high-drag projectile, with an open conical shape: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping feathers embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin leather or synthetic material. Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt.

  <h2>Shoes</h2>
  Badminton shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.
